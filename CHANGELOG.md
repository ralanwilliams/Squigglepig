# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- 1× / 2× switch on the drawing canvas; at 2× a minimap shows the visible window
- Two-finger slide moves the window at 2×; tapping or dragging the minimap jumps it
- A one-time hint teaches the two-finger slide the first time 2× is switched on
- Taps now draw dots

### Changed
- Drawings live in a fixed 400 × 300 space, so zoom and window survive rotation and strokes drawn before and after rotating line up
- In landscape the canvas takes the full pane height and the rail shrinks to fit beside it (drawing and guessing screens alike)
- Strokes are smoothed with quadratic curves instead of raw polylines
- Only the stroke under the finger re-renders while drawing, so ink no longer lags on busy canvases
- A second finger ends the current stroke instead of dragging it

### Fixed
- Rotating the phone no longer restarts the countdown on the drawing, guessing, prompt, view, and reveal screens

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed
- **Complete rebuild as mobile-first app** — migrated from web-based version to native mobile using Expo and React Native
- Redesigned UI for touch input and mobile viewports
- Rebuilt backend on Supabase for real-time multiplayer support
- Simplified game logic for mobile constraints (screen size, network, battery)

### Added
- Dark mode support across all screens
- Real-time game state sync with Supabase
- Proper safe-area handling for notched and edge-to-edge phones
- Responsive scaling that works across phone sizes and orientations
- Game state persistence (resume interrupted games)
- Audio feedback for game events

### Fixed
- Endgame logic cleaned up and simplified
- Game flow state machine made reliable for multiplayer context

### Removed
- Previous web-based deployment
- Legacy drawing format (now uses optimized vector strokes)
